# Operation: Ghost Identity

## Cloud Service Provider Used

AWS + Azure

## Story

A mysterious AMI (ami-01cb9f19b90008f38) has surfaced across compromised AWS accounts, seemingly benign but harboring hidden intentions. Created by the elusive rogue operator H3X-N0V4, the Windows image contains a concealed script that triggers unexpected behavior upon launch â€” exfiltrating data, evading logs, and possibly reaching into other cloud platforms. Though the Administrator account appears missing or altered, investigators recovered a single clue: the password CloudCTF2025!, hidden in a now-terminated EC2 instance. As part of the elite Cloud Response Unit, your mission is to deploy and analyze the image, uncover the hidden script, trace its behavior, and follow the trail that leads beyond the cloud you started in.
