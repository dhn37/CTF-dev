## Story
Buried in the dark corners of the arcade realm lies Shadowfire Keep, a forgotten dungeon from a corrupted cartridge. It‚Äôs cloaked in pixelated shadows, sealed by ancient code, and rumored to contain a secret so powerful it was locked behind layers of illusion.

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Only the clever, the curious, and the relentless have a chance to breach its firewall gates.

There are no glowing quest markers.
No friendly NPCs.
Only cryptic clues and misdirection.

Can you decode the glitches, uncover the unseen, and unlock the secret hidden within Shadowfire‚Äôs final level?

The keep waits.
Press Start to begin. üéÆ
