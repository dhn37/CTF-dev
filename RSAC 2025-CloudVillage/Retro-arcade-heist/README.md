## Story
ArcadiaNet was the ultimate retro gaming vault—home to legendary arcade classics and hidden secrets. But when the rogue hacker Glitchbyte breached its servers, they didn’t just steal high scores… they shattered the Arcade Master Flag, scattering its pieces across the arcade’s oldest games.

Each fragment is locked behind cryptic challenges—encoded in pixels, encrypted in soundtracks, or buried in glitched-out gameplay. To recover the flag, you’ll need more than quick reflexes. You’ll need to think like a hacker, play like a pro, and decode the arcade’s deepest secrets.

The games are waiting. The flag is hidden. Can you outsmart Glitchbyte and reclaim what was lost?

This isn’t just a game. It’s a heist. Your move, player.
