# Action Theft Repo

## Cloud Service Provider Used

AWS

## Story

HEXNOVA404 is a fast-growing security startup that was recently targeted in a mysterious breach. An attacker exploited a misconfigured GitHub Actions workflow to gain unauthorized access to sensitive AWS secrets. The attacker leveraged GitHub OIDC federation to assume an IAM role and retrieve credentials for another, more privileged role hidden inside AWS Secrets Manager.

To investigate and simulate the attack chain, the organization is now hiring skilled security researchers to retrace the adversaryâ€™s steps and uncover the final flag.
